## [Project 1 - Customer Churn Prediction Model](https://github.com/pabodaR/customer-churn-prediction/tree/main)

This project aims to predict customer churn for ABC Multistate Bank using machine learning techniques. The dataset includes various customer attributes such as credit score, age, balance, and whether they have churned (exited).

### Key Features:
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing and duplicate values, encoding categorical variables, normalization, and feature engineering.
- **Modeling:** Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and SVM were compared to find the best-performing model.
- **Evaluation:** Models were evaluated based on accuracy. The SVM model provided the best mix of training and testing accuracy without significant overfitting.
- **Results:** SVM is recommended due to its robustness and reliable performance in predicting customer churn.

## [Project 2 - Crop Yield Prediction Model](https://github.com/pabodaR/customer-churn-prediction/tree/main)

This project aims to predict crop yield using machine learning techniques. The dataset includes attributes such as Area, Crop name, Year, hg/ha_yield,	average rain fall in mm per year,	pesticides in tonnes, average temperature.

### Key Features:
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing and duplicate values, encoding categorical variables, and feature engineering.
- **Modeling:** Random Forest, and XGBoost were compared to find the best-performing model.
- **Evaluation:** Models were evaluated based on accuracy, R^2 value. Hyperparameter tuning and cross validation was performed to determine the most suitable model for the crop yield prediction task.
- **Results:** Random forest model is recommended due to lower RMSE since the R^2 values of the models are similar.
