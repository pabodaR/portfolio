## [Project 1 - Customer Churn Prediction Model](https://github.com/pabodaR/customer-churn-prediction/tree/main)

This project aims to predict customer churn for ABC Multistate Bank using machine learning techniques. The dataset includes various customer attributes such as credit score, age, balance, and whether they have churned (exited).

### Key Features:
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing and duplicate values, encoding categorical variables, normalization, and feature engineering.
- **Modeling:** Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and SVM were compared to find the best-performing model.
- **Evaluation:** Models were evaluated based on accuracy. The SVM model provided the best mix of training and testing accuracy without significant overfitting.
- **Results:** SVM is recommended due to its robustness and reliable performance in predicting customer churn.
